# Mobile app demo

They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Give thanks to the most high. Surround yourself with angels. They don’t want us to win. Give thanks to the most high. Give thanks to the most high. Fan luv. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.

## This is a heading

Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. They don’t want us to win. Stay focused. Cloth talk. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Stay focused.

## This is a second heading

I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Another one. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.

## Yes, one more heading!

I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Surround yourself with angels. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.
